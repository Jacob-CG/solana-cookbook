# Getting Started with Integrations

The Solana Cookbook integrations provides a set of examples and references for anyone
to build on top of other protocols on Solana. 

The power of Solana comes from the ability to integrate with other protocols,
building on top of existing infrastructure to make something better.

## Composability is Key

Making your program easy to use and extend will grow both your program and the
entire Solana ecosystem. Don't reinvent the wheel, build on top of existing protocols
and bootstrap your userbase.

Adapt and build on top of other programs or libraries and unlock new capabilities for Solana.
